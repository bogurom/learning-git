            <p class="song-info">Tom Waits</p>
            <p>It's dreamy weather<br>
                We're on<br>
                You waved your crooked wand<br>
                Along an icy pond<br>
                With a frozen moon<br>
                A murder of silhouette<br>
                Crows I saw<br>
                And the tears on my face<br>
                And the skates on the pond<br>
                They spell Alice<br>
                I disappear in your name<br>
                But you must wait for me<br>
                Somewhere across the sea<br>
                There's a wreck of a ship<br>
                Your hair is like meadow grass<br>
                On the tide<br>
                And the raindrops on my window<br>
                And the ice in my drink<br>
                Baby all I can think of<br>
                Is Alice<br>
                Arithmetic arithmetock<br>
                Turn the hands back on the clock<br>
                How does the ocean rock the boat?<br>
                How did the razor find my throat?<br>
                The only strings that hold me here<br>
                Are tangled up<br>
                Around the pier<br>
                And so a secret kiss<br>
                Brings madness with the bliss<br>
                And I will think of this<br>
                When I'm dead in my grave<br>
                Set me adrift<br>
                And I'm lost<br>
                Over there<br>
                And I must be insane<br>
                To go skating on your name<br>
                And by tracing it twice<br>
                I fell through the ice<br>
                Of Alice<br>
                And so a secret kiss<br>
                Brings madness with the bliss<br>
                And I will think of this<br>
                When I'm dead in my grave<br>
                Set me adrift<br>
                And I'm lost<br>
                Over there<br>
                And I must be insane<br>
                To go skating on your name<br>
                And by tracing it twice<br>
                I fell through the ice<br>
                Of Alice<br>
                There's only Alice<br>
